1. About                                                           *KISSabout*

KISS-Boilerplate is a boilerplate/snippet insertion plugin for Vim based
around the KISS principal (Keep It Stupendously Simple) and offers a fair
selection of customization.

1.1 Version                                                      *KISSversion*

KISS-Boilerplate uses semver (http://semver.org/) and is currently version
2.0.0

1.2 Repository                                                *KISSrepository*

The official KISS-Boilerplate repository is kept at
https://github.com/9999years/kiss-boilerplate.vim

Pull requests are always welcome! See also |KISScontributing|.

==============================================================================
2. Prerequisites                                           *KISSprerequisites*

KISS-Boilerplate requires at LEAST Vim 7.0 (which added |Dictionaries|).

It may require a Vim version greater than that, honestly, but I can't be
bothered to track down the version each |eval| feature was introduced in, but
I feel like 7.0 is a safe minimum.

==============================================================================
3. Usage                                                           *KISSusage*

NOTE: Unless KISS-Boilerplate is installed in
$VIM/vimfiles/pack/kiss-boilerplate/start/kiss-boilerplate, you will need to
set *g:kiss_boilerplate_root* to KISS-Boilerplate's installation path in your
|vimrc|.

KISS-Boilerplate registers an |autocmd| to call *KissInsertBoilerplate* on
|BufNewFile|, which reads the filetype (or argument, if supplied) and inserts
the contents of *g:kiss_boilerplate_root* /boilerplate/boiler.filetype.

If no such file is found or no filetype is supplied, nothing is read and no
text is inserted, making the plugin entirely harmless to undefined filetypes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 Commands                                                    *KISScommands*

:KISSInsertBoilerplate                                *:KISSInsertBoilerplate*

        KISSInsertBoilerplate() and its matching |ex-cmd| are the meat of
        KISS-Boilerplate. Without arguments, it reads from the filetype. With
        an argument, it reads from the argument. It's pretty simple. Maybe not
        stupendously so. That was just an ideal.

:KISSEditBoilerplate                                    *:KISSEditBoilerplate*

        KISSEditBoilerplate(<filetype>) (and its matching |ex-cmd|) allow you
        to easily edit a boilerplate file without having to type the whole
        mess of *g:kiss_boilerplate_root*

        It also sets |noeol|, so that inserting the boilerplate file doesn't
        lead to a spurious blank line at the end of the file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 Functions                                                  *KISSfunctions*

All the |KISScommands| have, of course, matching functions, but
listing them here would be unecessary.

KISSReload()                                                    *KISSReload()*

        KISSReload() refreshes the contents of the internal variable
        s:basefile to match *g:kiss_boilerplate_root*

        Call it after changing *g:kiss_boilerplate_root* to propogate changes,
        if you don't want to restart Vim.

==============================================================================
4. Options                                                       *KISSoptions*

loaded_kiss_boilerplate                          *KISSloaded_kiss_boilerplate*

        If loaded_kiss_boilerplate exists, KISS-Boilerplate is not loaded.

g:kiss_boilerplate_root                                             *KISSroot*

        The root path of the folder of the KISS-Boilerplate installation.
        This should contain a plugin folder with the Vimscript file and a
        boilerplate folder with the boilerplate files.

        The default is set up for Vim 8.0's |packages|.

        let g:kiss_boilerplate_root =
        \'$VIM/vimfiles/pack/KISS-Boilerplate/start/KISS-Boilerplate'
<

g:kiss_boilerplate_synonyms                                     *KISSsynonyms*

        A |dict| to create synonyms so that boilerplate files can be accessed
        with multiple filetypes or to extend KISS-Boilerplate as a snippet
        engine.
        This is useful for programming languages like C, where you may want
        the same boilerplate to be inserted for many possible extensions.

                \}

All contributions are welcome! I'd love to expand the collection of
boilerplate / snippet files. Send all pull requests to the |KISSrepository|!
